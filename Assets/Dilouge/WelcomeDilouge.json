My name is Amelia, and I am the land owner of the farm.","\n","^Let me give you a quick rundown. The farm is a bit of a mess as you can see. I am giving you a discount on your rent for you to clean it up.","\n","^The soil here is prefect for growing cotton. There is plenty of space for you to expand. I recommend you use fertilizer, that way your crops grow faster and make more money.","\n","^Here, we got a big barn that you can use for storage and for your workshop. There are some simple machines left in there that you can use.","\n","^Next to the barn there is a fenced off area for the sheep to graze.","\n","^Lastly, the local shop is just at the edge of the property. You can buy seeds and whatnot in there.","\n","^The shopkeeper is called Vera.
